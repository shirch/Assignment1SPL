An object-oriented system in C++

## Assignment Goals
The objective of this assignment is to design an object-oriented system and gain implementation
experience in C++ while using classes, standard data structures and unique C++ properties such
as the “Rule of 5”. You will learn how to handle memory in C++ and avoid memory leaks. The
resulting program must be as efficient as possible.
## Assignment Definition
In this assignment you will write a C++ program that simulates a naïve hierarchical computer file
system.
To communicate with the file system, you will implement a command-line/terminal that enables
the user to create/delete files/folders, print the contents of a directory etc.
The file system consists of a root directory (“/”) and optionally other files and directories
underneath.
